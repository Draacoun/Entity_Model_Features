# Entity Model Features




    its CEM time muthafucka


fixed random model properties not updating unless you reload
fixed baby llama scaling
fixed the `visible` animation key
fixed horse rein and saddle desync
actually fixed `is_sitting` variable (i was reading the server side unsynced value :/)
endermen aggro animation in FA reported broken but seems to work
added tickdelta to hurt_time to reduce jitteriness
models with saddle variants will now all load those saddle variants instead of the regular one
fixed strider animation loading order (this might not be an actual fix I only have a sample size of 1 for the underlying issue)
fixed witch nose lifting not being readable in the custom model
